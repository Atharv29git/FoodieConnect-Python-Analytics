🍕 FoodieConnect — Data Analysis Project (Pure Python)

FoodieConnect is a beginner-friendly data analysis project built using pure Python, simulating a real-world Data Analyst internship task.
The project analyzes users, restaurants, and food ratings to generate insights and recommendations — without using any external libraries like pandas or numpy.

📌 Project Objective

To understand how raw JSON data can be:
Loaded
Cleaned
Analyzed
Used for recommendations
using basic Python programming concepts such as dictionaries, lists, loops, and functions.

🗂️ Project Structure
FoodieConnect/
│
├── Data.json        # Raw dataset (users & restaurants)
├── task1.py         # Load and explore data
├── task2.py         # Data cleaning & preprocessing
├── task3.py         # Restaurant recommendation system
└── task4.py         # Aggregations & insights

🔍 Features Implemented
✅ Data Loading & Exploration
Reads real .json data
Displays users and restaurants
🧹 Data Cleaning
Removes users with missing names
Fixes invalid ratings (keeps only 1–5)
Deduplicates restaurants
Normalizes restaurant IDs
🤝 Recommendation System
Suggests restaurants based on shared food preferences
Uses simple collaborative filtering logic
⭐ Restaurant Analytics
Calculates average rating per restaurant
Finds top-rated restaurants

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Concepts Used:
